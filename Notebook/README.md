# Residential Housing Rental Adds Analysis across Canada

## Objective
The goal is to explore 3 different regression models representing the price of residential housing rental adds with the various rental criteria. A thorough analysis will be performed in order to select one model that predict the rental price most accurately. The most accurate model will tested against completely new independent data from 2025 to evaluate its realtime performance,

### Step 1: Data Cleaning,

Data cleaning is crucial for data analysis. The cleaned data can be found here [Cleaned Dataset](../Data/canada_rent_clean.csv)

1- From the original dataset, only the residential housing rental adds will be kept for the analysis.
2- Columns with information not needed for the analysis will be discarded

### Step 2 : Data Analysis

1. The first step is the clean the data
      * From the original dataset, only the residential housing rental adds will be kept for the analysis.
      * 
      * An interactive pie chart will be produced to see the percentage of station and count of station in each category.
